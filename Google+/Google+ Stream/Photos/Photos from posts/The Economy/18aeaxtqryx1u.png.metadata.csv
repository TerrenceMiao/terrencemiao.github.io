Have you noticed Mac mini, which Apple always has the advantage in design the product of the future? Maybe it predicts the fate of PC, which the monitor, keyboard and mouse are becoming not the essential parts of PC.<br />2. Apple again. It is considering replacing Intel inside MacBook Pro with ARM processor. Yes, the ARM, the same processor for iPhone and iPad. That tells you something, ARM has all the potential becomes substituted heart of a &quot;PC&quot;.<br />3. Intel, on the other hand, is moving to design the processor for mobile devices - smartphone, tablets. This means the end of WINTEL domination on PC in last twenty years, also means computing in future will be more mobile, lighter and less power demand.<br /><br />Eyes wildly open. These change is coming. Stop upgrading more powerful graphic cards for your games binge. Buy some shares of ARM Holdings. It&#39;s British, who designed and licensed ARM architecture. In 2011, 7.9 billion ARM processors shipped, representing 95% of smartphones, 90% of hard disk drives, 40% of digital televisions and set-top boxes, 15% of micro controllers and 20% of mobile computers.; Don&#39;t worry about those losers... <b>NVidia</b> and <b>AMD</b> are going to take over the world and everything will run on GPU&#39;s only in just two years time. If I&#39;m wrong I will eat my hat!<br /><br /><i>hahaha</i>","; ; ; ","; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
