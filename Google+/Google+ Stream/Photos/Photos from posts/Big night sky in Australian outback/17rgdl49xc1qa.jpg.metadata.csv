"article-0-0DA1234F00000578-475_964x568.jpg","PIC BY LINCOLN HARRISON / CATERS NEWS - Photographer Lincoln Harrison was really shooting for the stars with this spectacular collection of snaps. His unrivalled pictures of star trails were taken over a period of up to 15 hours in Bendigo, Australia over the scenic Lake Eppalock. Captured using a long exposure lens, the trails are created as the Earth rotates, giving the impression of the stars moving across the sky. Lincoln, 36, bought his first camera last year to take pictures of clothes he wanted to sell on eBay.
