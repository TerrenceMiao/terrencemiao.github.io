"Samsung Galaxy S3.png","Samsung Galaxy S3 - directly from first pressing

If you don't pop into a pub and fuel your bladder with yellow coloured stuff after work on Friday, what else you can do?

Surprisingly know the red hot Samsung Galaxy S3 released in Australian market on its first shift, I found a Vodofail shop was selling it when I turned corner in Swanston street. Grabbed a white S3 in my hand I kept playing with it for half an hour. It's just an amazing blissful experience.

• stunning beautiful large screen, but still can hold firmly in single hand

• vivid and rich colour, remind me when I was watching a 50""++ Smart TV in electronic goods shop, with $4,000 - $5,000 price tag and the saliva full of my mouth

• so thin and so light. I worry that I could break it into pieces if I squeeze harder. Better buy a thick and heavy protected case as well when order the phone

• If Flipboard is the only killer application for iOS that kill Android thousands time, Flipboard, let me say it again Flipboard is running on ICS on S3 now!

• ICS in developer mode has GPS mock. This is great news for people test GPS based application. I still remember a poor tester had to carry a phone testing the app on the way to office and back way to home.

Anyway, this is a phone worth of all your time you have waited for. Already there is an Aussie shop on internet is selling S3 for $718.95 now. The price will keep dropping if you are a bit more patient.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--yKFFI_RKHE/T8noP4bW76I/AAAAAAAADD4/gvKFz-NL0UQwYO79HWK-PdU7z24zT2wwACLABGAYYCw/s0-d/Samsung%2BGalaxy%2BS3.png","","1104","Jun 2, 2012, 10:17:35 AM UTC","Feb 5, 2019, 8:51:47 PM UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","Awesome.

I&#39;m pretty sold on just getting one regardless.; It&#39;s a really beautiful piece of art when you hold it in your hand, I mean it.<br /><br />You can live a life without love. But you can&#39;t live a life without this beauty :-) ","; ","; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
