What does the industry have to show after $3bn worth of innovation funding? The currency issue is a flimsy excuse. These guys struggle to compete with imports even when the Aussie is weak.  What has kept them going thus far has been local love of gas guzzlers, misplaced nationalism and my tax dollars. This is all changing.<br><br>Schumpeter&#39;s creative destruction needs to take place. Inefficient manufacturers need to die and respawn with faster and more nimble business models.
