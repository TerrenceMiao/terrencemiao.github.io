"samsung_apple_store_protest.jpg","Wake Up

A black bus with ""Wake Up"" written on the side pulled up and out poured a group of black-clad protesters with signs which read, ""Wake Up."" The protesters proceeded to stand in front of the Apple store in Sydney CBD and shout ""wake up!""

Samsung is believed to be the mastermind and ""dirty hands"" behind the campaign â€“ a local activation by tongue for the global launch of the Samsung Galaxy S3 smart phone.

Pump up your mouth water before you can see the real product. Brilliant!

She asked me whether I should buy a latest Blackberry playbook and develop some apps on it. I replied her I was not a fan of Blackberry at all, and its tiny size, full-keys keyboard. <br /><br />She looked quite disappointed. Later I knew she&#39;s the representative from RIM, the only sponsor for seminar and the free beer.<br /><br />Oops ...; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872"" oid=""112201754385215382872"">Terrence Miao</a></span> hehe which mobile seminar was that MoMoMelb (where I remember the rather lame introduction fo &#39;playbook&#39; by a RIM rep (also a event sponsor of course) - like one year before production... ;)<br /><br />or the seminar run by my friend &quot;Dr Nick&quot;?
