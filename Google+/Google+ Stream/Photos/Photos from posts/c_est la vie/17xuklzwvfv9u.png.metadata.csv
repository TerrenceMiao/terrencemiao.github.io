"Energy Saver.png","Registered Energy Saving plan to get FREE SmartSwitch installed at home, which sponsored by Australian Government, in another words, in full tax-payers' money.

According to Embertec, up to $200 electricity bill can be saved every year after SmartSwitch installed. I'm not fully convinced. However, if $1 saved from running cost, that is $1 gain added into profit. This is lesson learned from One Dollar Economy.

I guess that&#39;s not the worst of things our taxpayers money go to these days... ;-); We just got given a smart powerboard by someone coming to the door.  In the past we have rejected the Embertec devices because the &quot;technician&quot; insists on &quot;installing&quot; it but I am not interested in any random joe coming into the house.  My wife was able to convince the powerboard guy to give it to her without coming inside so we took it.  You plug the TV into the &quot;control&quot; socket of the powerboard and it automatically shuts down the &quot;slave&quot; sockets (eg DVD, cordless headphone base station, receiver, etc) when it detects low power.  It has an IR Detector that it uses to remotely power everything back on.  It clearly must have its own &quot;standby&quot; but you have to trust it is less than all the other devices.  Here is a link: <a href=""http://wattsclever.com/product/auto-power-board-AUS-ESAUS1001"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://wattsclever.com/product/auto-power-board-AUS-ESAUS1001</a>; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/113772070338256541416"" oid=""113772070338256541416"">Bryan Murphy</a></span> looks like a very sensible solution... I guess it also has a proper surge protector &amp; filter like any normal powerboard would... ;); Yeah it has surge and power protection.  It also has a feature (which could easily become annoying) that if it doesn&#39;t detect any IR for 1 hour it shuts down. It has some flashing lights warning you for 5 minutes so whilst at first it looks painful for when you are watching a 2 hour DVD, you would probably notice the flashing and hit something on the remote.  This feature has dubious value for me since I don&#39;t tend to leave the TV on but for people with TVs in their bedroom it could be handy.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/113772070338256541416"" oid=""113772070338256541416"">Bryan Murphy</a></span> hei, that&#39;s a good feature - to make sure that whatever one is watching is actually worth it or they just been lazy to lift a finger and turn it off !! ;-)<br /> <br />(again see that link I already posted here - <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2196253/Blink-youll-miss-Eye-control-TV-arrives-lets-couch-potatoes-change-channel-lifting-finger.html"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2196253/Blink-youll-miss-Eye-control-TV-arrives-lets-couch-potatoes-change-channel-lifting-finger.html</a> <br />;)","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
