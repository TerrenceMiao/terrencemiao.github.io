Apple's stock price closed just above $702 in September 2012, and finished at $518 on Dec 17 2012.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-E3Dspz3eRcU/UNBPbJBl38I/AAAAAAAAFHA/LujUOgLCgHgkwzcaWdyKnMmec93p3nkRgCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/Apple%2Bproduct%2Blaunch%2Band%2Bstock%2Bprice.png","","326","Dec 18, 2012, 11:11:40 AM UTC","Feb 5, 2019, 8:51:47 PM UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","Good. Maybe one day they&#39;ll become the hard working underdog again.<br /><br />In the meantime, it will only ever truly be over for them, IMHO, if they lose Jony Ive. While he&#39;s there, sexy stuff will keep on coming out.; I think Apple still has some upside.  Whilst I personally don&#39;t like there digital handcuffs the great unwashed majority are happy for Apple to do all their thinking for them.  I am quite surprised they haven&#39;t nailed the TV integration experience yet but it can&#39;t be too long before they have an iOS powered Apple TV (with apps) and seamless, wireless integration with iPad and iPhone.  That is where I see the next growth part for Apple.  Google/Android has also botched the TV so far and they don&#39;t do integration as well as Apple so competition will be minimal initially.; Internet TV is the next big thing I reckon after smartphone s and tablets.; I don&#39;t think Internet TV will be <i>it</i> . It might be in the US, but connectivity in most other countries rich enough to potentially sustain the preference is relatively poor.<br /><br />Even in the US it is in doubt, given how their ISPs are introducing download quotas.<br /><br />If the market became sophisticated enough that ISPs struck deals for unmetered traffic with content providers, the market would likely go through a period of horrible fragmentation.<br /><br />FWIW, IMHO I would expect Google&#39;s effort to have a small advantage because of ownership of YouTube.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/113772070338256541416"" oid=""113772070338256541416"">Bryan Murphy</a></span> <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872"" oid=""112201754385215382872"">Terrence Miao</a></span> <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/111056023099743566557"" oid=""111056023099743566557"">Alex Megremis</a></span> oh please don&#39;t let Apple control the TV media!!!  The pain I had to endure just to watch a 90 second Star Trek movie trailer on the Apple website on my Ubuntu computer was a disgrace.  If it weren&#39;t because it was /star trek/ I would have given up (it took me 45 minutes to get it running).<br /><br />If the movie trailer had been on YouTube I would have had no problems viewing it.<br /><br />And why on earth they prevent you from downloading your own copy of the trailer, so you can watch it when/however you want is ludicrous.  Surely the point of a movie trailer is to get many people to see it and motivate them to see the movie at the cinema!  Sharing should be encouraged!!","; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
