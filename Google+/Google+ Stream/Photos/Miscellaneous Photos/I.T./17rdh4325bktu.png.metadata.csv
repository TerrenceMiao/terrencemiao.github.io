Five years ago, we had WinMerge and P4Merge doing file comparison and merge. Today we have Deltopia DeltaWalker to carry on more sophisticated work, and do it better.

Base on Eclipse platform (so it can run on Windows, Mac and Linux), this genuine productive tool helping you look deeply inside your project, files or folder, sync, compare and merge, what you did great, what you did just crap.

You finish first, check in as B, I modify as C and want to check in. Need 3-way comparison to see what you have changed from A to B and what I have changed from A to C. Though still can use two-way comparison. But 3-way is more clean and easily to understand.; There&#39;s always the odd occasion when you do have to merge, but merges should be so small as to be insignificant.<br /><br />Always remember the practice of <b>Continuous Integration</b>; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/117411118917273581736"" oid=""117411118917273581736"">Dean Budd</a></span> Good point Deano! Merge should be as insignificant as possible in development. If merge takes outstanding amount time, either it&#39;s design fault, or the false efficiency of task splitting.<br /><br />One thing I like Git is it does smart merge. Most of time, you just commit your codes, Git has an intelligent solution merge them without too many human intervention. ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
