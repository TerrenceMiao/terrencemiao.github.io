Much more so than anything which is going on Federally (although the potential scaling back of the NBN is something that concerns me).<br><br><br>Could the current Victorian coalition government be a one-term government? Perhaps our mainstream media have been too distracted with Julia to notice the troubles in this state, with the Coalition on a whisper thin margin of 1 seat - a margin that&#39;s under threat with incidents such as that with the member for Frankston.<br><br>I&#39;m particularly concerned with the disregard being paid to education in the latest budget, which is nothing to mention all the broken promises that Ted is leaving strewn in his wake. But these cuts to education - they could really come back to bite, especially in the long-term.<br><br>I don&#39;t understand how it is sensible to throw more money into law and order (e.g. prisons) instead of education. A good education will help keep people out of the prison system!<br><br>Antony Green has posted an interesting analysis on the redistribution of seats to take place before the next election. The Liberals and Nationals could lose safe seats, whilst Labor gain more:<br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/05/prospects-for-the-victorian-state-redistribution.html" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/05/prospects-for-the-victorian-state-redistribution.html</a><br><br>So - It&#39;s not just poor performance that the Baillieu Government need to contend with.<br><br>Back to education, the TAFE sector is going to see massive cut backs later this year. Crisis meetings are now taking place; we&#39;re looking at colleges and universities being short tens of millions of dollars. Staff will lose their jobs, courses will be cut, and quality will deteriorate.<br><br>Could the impact of these cuts be felt in the bush also? The Age&#39;s Farrah Tomazin wrote an opinion piece the other day suggesting it just might: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/bush-or-bust-20120519-1yxix.html" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/bush-or-bust-20120519-1yxix.html</a><br><br>I&#39;m disappointed to see cuts to cycling infrastructure funding. Cycling is surging in this city, and is becoming an important part of the commute to work. Some eye-opening stats here from Bicycle Network Victoria <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/general/change-the-world/93685/" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/general/change-the-world/93685/</a><br><br>But alas, more cuts to funding for cyclists: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/baillieu-slashes-construction-of-cycling-projects-20120521-1z1ed.html" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/baillieu-slashes-construction-of-cycling-projects-20120521-1z1ed.html</a><br><br>And what about keeping down the cost of living for Victorians? That promise came true when landfill levies to local councils went up over 600% <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.maroondahweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/maroondah-baulks-at-rise-in-landfill-levy/2555303.aspx" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.maroondahweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/maroondah-baulks-at-rise-in-landfill-levy/2555303.aspx</a> Clever ploy, by making the councils carry the message to the voters?<br><br>Sure - Ted has a difficult task in trying to balance the budget. GST revenue from the federal Government is not what he&#39;d like to see, and the state&#39;s economy has slowed. Add to that the Liberals politically-charged need to remain in surplus - it makes for a difficult mix. But then that&#39;s why I&#39;d like to see some of those silly promises dumped, like PSOs at train stations. I think the funding is needed elsewhere.<br><br>So, difficult times are ahead for this state and its Coalition Government. Will Ted and his colleagues find themselves still in office after the next election? Can they make it there? Are the Labor Party ready to step back into Government so soon??<a href="http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/05/prospects-for-the-victorian-state-redistribution.html" target="_blank" class="link-embed"><h3>Antony Green&#39;s Election Blog: Prospects for the Victorian State Redistribution</h3><img src="http://blogs.abc.net.au/.a/6a00e0097e4e688833016305b76361970d-500wi" alt=""></a></div></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public</div><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656">Kieran Simpson</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656">Kieran Simpson</a></div></div></body></html>
