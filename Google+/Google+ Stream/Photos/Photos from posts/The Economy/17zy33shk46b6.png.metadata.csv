The point to make is in a fair society people should work if they have the ability, and take a fair share (dividend) after their retirement. Social security is to help people who need support, but not support bludgers who abuse welfare schema. In a democrate country like Australia, sadly the constitution still allow those welfare cheaters to play, vote and reproduce.   ; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/108100508440823014305"" oid=""108100508440823014305"">Oleg Kiorsak</a></span> Oleg, you are my man! It&#39;s all the fairness of tax system. People on high income could make bigger contribution to society if they pay in higher tax bracket. Tax is good vehicle to balance the development, narrow the gap between wealth and  poverty. But it&#39;s commonly abused by the pollies buying the cheap vote by brainwashing the unsophisticated electors.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872"" oid=""112201754385215382872"">Terrence Miao</a></span> I think the rates do get high enough... it is just that if you are not just a salaried professional, but a more &quot;advanced&quot; entrepreneurial type with &quot;flexible principles&quot;, there are plenty of &quot;loopholes&quot; and &quot;perfectly legit&quot; schemes as well to &quot;optimize&quot; taxes...  I guess you pollies friends keep them in because the use them themselves quite a lot... ;)<br /><br />btw, speaking of pollies - what you think of this news:<br /><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/21/wayne-swan-republicans-cranks-crazies"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/21/wayne-swan-republicans-cranks-crazies</a><br />(got it via an American friend on FB ;)<br /><br />I am not familiar with Mr. Swan too much, but I have a vague feeling that it sounds like he is being credited for something that is hardly much of his &quot;credit&quot;...<br />??; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/108100508440823014305"" oid=""108100508440823014305"">Oleg Kiorsak</a></span> Wayne Swan is the luckest treasurer simply because Australia is the luckest country. A coalition government maybe can achieve the same result in this crisis. I doubt single political party have the power and influence in one single term than the reverse bank.<br /><br />I agree his &quot;cranks and crazies&quot; about Republicans. Mitt Romney is a successful business man, but the common senses doesn&#39;t make sense to his tax cut meanwhile debt reduce plan. And his &quot;Just get me into White House and I will tell you how to achieve this&quot; seems quite dodgy.<br /><br />However, U.S. election is still toe to toe at the moment, and it&#39;s hard to predict. Historical records tell you that you just can&#39;t overestimate the intelligence of American voters. One main reason is half of them couldn&#39;t speak and write English right.<br /><br /><b>&quot;English? Who needs that?
