If it makes makes farmers &#39;reacher&#39; - that is only fair, IMHO.<br>as far as &quot;lower-income Australians&quot; - this a total B/S argument - just look around how much those &quot;lower-income&quot; spend on JUNK food!! - surely they can afford bananans instead even at the current prices...<br><br>(btw, besides purely economic reasons, there are valid quarantine reasons on importing stuff - Australia has a very long list of examples when some &#39;innocent&#39; creatures ended up been a pest and &#39;plague&#39; here... no need to risk the agriculture by introducing some crap that you will later need to &#39;neutralize&#39; by generously spraying pesticides left sand right... ) <br><br><br><br>RE: $360,000 and in Britain you could get the exact same car for $110,000. All I can say here - &quot;Give me a break!&quot; ;-))<br><br>Luckily, UN-like many other countries there are still <i>locally</i> assembled cars here - you can get a very decent brand-new Holden, Toyota and &quot;Magnas&quot; for a very reasonable price.<br><br><br><br>RE: house pricing<br>yes, these are artificially and unreasonably high... and Government did contribute to that (real estate &amp; banking industry), especially during &quot;GFC&quot;...<br><br>BUT at least there is still employment and stability... (so far anyway)<br><br>also you need to give credit to the fact that regulatory framework (set up by Government) here has prevented a ridiculous US-style real estate (&quot;sub-prime&quot;, &quot;derivatives&quot;, etc) scams and subsequent crisis...<br><br><br>I am usually first one to &#39;whinge&#39; and criticize (been really badly screwed by real estate story contributes to that), but nowadays when looking around (EU and US) I have to admit that AU is indeed a &#39;lucky country&#39; still/...

Basically, if you spend 50 grands, you can drive away an Audi TT; if you have A$ 70,000, you can buy a new Porsche. <br><br>U.S. doesn&#39;t have the high tax on import cars, even native three car giant almost bankrupted during GFC. <br><br>On the contrary, Australia is an extreme example of protectionism. Not only in its industry, agriculture, mining, banking, even in retailing.<br><br>Result of protectionism is there is no world famous brand like Coca-cola, Microsoft, Walmart in Australia. There is no such the richest person like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett from Australia. <br><br>Australian businesses are hard competing in world stage. <br><br>News Corp. is born here, but run on the bending of &quot;ethics and integrity&quot;. The top 10 richest people in Australia are in mining, property development and casinos.</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+OlegKiorsak" class="author">Oleg Kiorsak</a><span class="time"> - 2011-12-15 13:37:49+1100</span><div class="comment-content">But I would argue (and I am not that wise, I heard it elsewhere - in fact on &quot;Java Posse&quot; podcast by vague memories ;)<br>that the reason US has great track record of business success stories startups/entrepreneurs - when compared with EU/AU - is the difference in industrial relationship / employment regulations... in US there&#39;s is very low risk&amp;obligation if<br>you start a company and employ lots of people and it doesn&#39;t work <br>out quite as well as expected - you can just close the doors and say &#39;good bye&#39; to all <br><br>not so easy here, and especially not in the &quot;western socialism&quot; EU countries...<br><br>this is why it&#39;s more risky to start and especially <i>grow</i> a business<br><br>(btw, I am not upset at all there are no reaches person coming out of Australia... (except Murdoch ;)... <br><br>In fact there are lots os insanely reach persons coming out of my &quot;old country&quot; - (ex-)USSR... but somehow that does not make me feel any better :(</div></div></div></body></html>
