But it&#39;s still good to watch action movie and sports on plasma. The latest LED with 200Mhz frequency TV still can&#39;t match plasma in this category :-)</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TerrenceMiao" class="author">Terrence Miao</a><span class="time"> - 2012-02-07 11:06:43+1100</span><div class="comment-content">Who is still using Walkman today if there is an iPod?
