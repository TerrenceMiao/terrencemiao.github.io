It&#39;s like between Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley who you want to marry, but you can only marry one of them. American beauty vs. England Rose, trust me, it&#39;s really a tough decision.<br><br>One of colleagues just shows me off his latest bought Google Nexus 7 today. Thin, light, snappily fast. Reading a book on it is a blissful experience. Animation, when you turn the page, is closely as good as Flipboard. Comparing side by side, my first generation Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7 just looks fat, ugly and stupid. <br><br>Another colleague already had Samsung Galaxy S3 (the blue version) for months. During the day, when other colleagues work hard almost have their arse off, he listens and enjoys the music in Sportfy, music stored in the cloud, by using his Samsung Galaxy S3. He told me 2GB download quota from Telstra is quite generous. He never got over the limit.<br><br>All good, now the problem is the price. <br><br>You can buy Samsung Galaxy S3 from Kogan&#39;s pirate paradise for $539. Thanks for soaring Aussie dollars. Or buy Google Nexus 7 from Google Play for $249. <br><br>However, Google Nexus 7 are selling in U.S. for only US$ 199. One Aussie dollar can buy 1.05 U.S. buck, the distance between manufacturer in China to United States, is further than distance to Down Under. Shipment is definitely cheaper sending goods here. This kind of trading discrimination and unfairness make the exactly same product here is almost 50% expensive than U.S. That&#39;s is you called lucky country. Blaming a democratically elected government, like Alan Jones shits on Julia Gillard day in and day out, only making terminally stupid himself. <br><br>Another thing is lesson learned again and again from previous experience is you should never never buy something hype. Facebook stock, Microsoft Windows 1.0 and the first generation iPhone, paying the price at the top.<br><br>People who bought first iPhone either had already upgraded to iPhone 4S (of course as a-never-returned-investment in life), or still use the oldie phone on and off, making them look like congenital cretins. <br><br>So the best strategy is still keep looking, keep money as close as in your pocket, keep waiting for the perfect fat pitch to come along before swinging.<br><br>Cheerio!</div></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872">Terrence Miao</a></div><div class="comments"><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/113772070338256541416" class="author">Bryan Murphy</a><span class="time"> - 2012-08-17 00:41:55+1000</span><div class="comment-content">Clearly the answer is to get both and throw in an ASUS Transformer Infinity to cover you for the larger size as well.  That&#39;s what I would do if I could shut up the annoying little voice in my head that tells me that the lovely shiny useful gadgets that I know I need are actually the epitome of what is wrong in the world (endless consumption and dissatisfaction with what we already have)</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/116375054168126712231" class="author">Luca Marchal</a><span class="time"> - 2012-08-17 02:31:10+1000</span><div class="comment-content">I would go with the nexus trust me you won&#39;t regret it I have a 7 and it is great go with the seven and you will love it</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/116375054168126712231" class="author">Luca Marchal</a><span class="time"> - 2012-08-17 02:31:21+1000</span><div class="comment-content">I would go with the nexus trust me you won&#39;t regret it I have a 7 and it is great go with the seven and you will love it</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656" class="author">Kieran Simpson</a><span class="time"> - 2012-08-17 08:55:29+1000</span><span> - Updated: 2012-08-17 08:57:24+1000</span><div class="comment-content">There will always be something new that appeals on either a technical or aesthetic level.
