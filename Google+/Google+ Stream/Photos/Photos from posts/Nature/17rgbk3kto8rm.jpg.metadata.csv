"article-0-002B294200000258-537_634x252.jpg","At 2.4 miles around, this particle ""racetrack"" has two lanes, yellow and blue, for the split beam. At six intersection points (orange boxes in the image above), the beams collide -- and the physics begins.  At four of the intersections, physicists have built giant experiments to capture the products of RHIC collisions for study. The beam of heavy ions starts out in the Tandem Van de Graaff at the bottom right, moves to the booster and Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) where  beam energies are increased before the beam is injected into RHIC.Photo from Edit International.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UWVmc2b8IwM/T_AC5d0if2I/AAAAAAAADQc/wdv5M_eT9nAQM7SXm5cGsodi6YO39TkcQCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/article-0-002B294200000258-537_634x252.jpg","","436","Jul 1, 2012, 7:57:25 AM UTC","Feb 11, 2016, 1:02:20 PM UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0"
