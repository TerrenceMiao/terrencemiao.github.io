Object orientation was the new holy grail, and people even wanted to push objects down into databases. Object databases were invented (luckily, they’re all dead) and the SQL standard was enhanced with ORDBMS features.<br /><br />Since Java 8, finally, starting to recover from the damage that was made in early days of object orientation in the 90s, and can move back to a more data-centric, functional, immutable programming model where data processing languages like SQL are appreciated rather than avoided.<br /><br /><a href=""https://dzone.com/articles/how-functional-programming-will-finally-do-away-wi"" class=""ot-anchor"">https://dzone.com/articles/how-functional-programming-will-finally-do-away-wi</a>; Steam API in Java 8 is like saying &quot;we salute you SQL&quot;.","; ; ","; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
