When engineers open their laptops the first time they should have a welcome email from the bootcamp manager or their bootcamp mentor and a bunch of work assigned to them to get started on.<br>•	Bootcamp is different for every new engineer. Each individual is coming from a different background and likely has different interests. Once we get past a basic bar of ability to do the job, we work with the engineers to make sure we&#39;re providing them with help that will lead to long term success here.<br>•	Bootcamp can help everyone. From the most senior director or VP to the newest college grad, incoming engineers often express concerns that bootcamp isn&#39;t right for them. Through talking with people immediately following bootcamp and also at 3 and 6 month intervals we can say quite confidently that it really does help everyone. The entire engineering organization all the way up to Zuck believes this.<br>•	Bootcamp is not meant to make people comfortable. We should be pushing people beyond their limits and encouraging them to explore technologies outside their area of expertise.<br>◦	If someone is an expert at machine learning, then we shouldn&#39;t make that part of bootcamp since we already believe they are experts at it; instead we should invite them to explore technologies that surround their expertise at Facebook.<br>◦	People building front end software need to understand the stack upon which their software runs. People writing back end software need to understand the clients they will be supporting.<br>◦	Learning <b>the core code base</b> is important for building good software, no matter where in the stack someone ends up working, and it also improves empathy for other engineers.<br>•	Bootcamp mentors get valuable returns for their time. The engineers get hands on technical leadership and manager experience in a controlled environment.<br><br>Read more: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/facebook-engineering-bootcamp/177577963919" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/facebook-engineering-bootcamp/177577963919</a> </div><a href="https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150411360573109" target="_blank" class="link-embed"><h3>Facebook Bootcamp | Facebook</h3></a></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public</div></body></html>
