You now have a problem of fairness to contend with. You could argue that &quot;the greatest number of people&quot; require bigger, better, faster roads rather the handful that use your bikepath.; I was actually thinking of the train system.  Plus it was a cheap shot, somewhat tongue in cheek.; Privately operated railways will struggle in newly settled regions.  Early in Melbourne&#39;s history all the railways were privately built and owned.   When they inevitably failed, in part due to the motorcar and in some places poor planning (e.g. the Deepdene line faced competition from trams too), the Governments took them over. <br /><br />Melbourne is indeed fortunate that these early pioneers build those railways, as they provide a vital backbone to the city&#39;s public transport.  It&#39;s a shame that so little investment has been made in the past 100 years to expand upon it as the population grew &amp; expanded.  Only Governments can put in this sort of infrastructure these days, except for the miners who can still turn a profit because they make so much $$ out of the dirt they shift.","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
