This is very interesting, because I always believe performance issue is the biggest hinder for Hibernate in an Enterprise level JPA solution. <br><br>Another related thing I need to mention is the project Mr. B and I are working on, an Oracle proprietary implementation. With Oracle DB, SOA, Weblogic J2EE Server, JPA, Coherence ... everything locked in Oracle. So every time when we confront with JPA bugs, Coherence performance issue, just like hitting a big wall that hardly to break in. <br><br>But, we need Oracle. Not only because venders like to pay big bucks to Oracle and let them feel good, but also because &quot;J2EE server is very good at BPEL and ESB stuff&quot;, as Mr. J pointed out. So I have been thinking that is it possible just run J2EE (Weblogic) for BPEL (high level business stuff), and let everything else (Java stuff) be managed by Spring (as it should be). <br><br>Benefit from Spring&#39;s Inversion of Control especially Dependency Injection, Aspect-Oriented Programming, and other standard consistent Spring&#39;s components - Spring Web Servies, Batch, Security, Integration ..., lighter, out-of-container test framework, and powerful business products (24x7 support), so this article maybe points the direction how to let OS solutions work together with commercial proprietary applications.<br><br>Read more: How do I integrate Coherence and Hibernate? - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://coherence.oracle.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16730" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">http://coherence.oracle.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16730</a></div><a href="http://middlewaremagic.com/weblogic/?p=5407" target="_blank" class="link-embed"><h3>Hibernate and Coherence « Middleware Magic</h3></a></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: <a href="https://plus.google.com/108100508440823014305">Oleg Kiorsak</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/113772070338256541416">Bryan Murphy</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656">Kieran Simpson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104947156656943348622">James Gemmell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117411118917273581736">Dean Budd</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872">Terrence Miao</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656">Kieran Simpson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104947156656943348622">James Gemmell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872">Terrence Miao</a></div><div class="comments"><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656" class="author">Kieran Simpson</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-13 11:09:05+1100</span><div class="comment-content">There&#39;s a lot of factors here:<br><br>- I&#39;m assuming the JPA implementation is EclipseLink (TopLink).

We have Spring registered as a Servlet listener so it does all the important work with JBoss providing the plumbing.  Given Weblogic would probably also be JTA compliant (and all that other distributed transaction nonsense you might need for dealing with the Oracle BHELL beast) you get the best of both worlds.<br><br>I&#39;d ditch Coherence though :p ;)</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TerrenceMiao" class="author">Terrence Miao</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-13 11:50:08+1100</span><div class="comment-content">Many thanks for your thought K!<br><br>- Yep, current JPA implementation in Weblogic is EclipseLink (buggy).<br>- Weblogic 10 is only JEE 5 compatible. JEE 6 support you have to wait till Weblogic 12 released.<br>- Agree, still need Weblogic does the application plumbing work as many as possible. <br>- Have to stick with Coherence. Our implementation of coherence in our project is inappropriate because this memory cache is used to hold data that is updated frequently. This caused performance downgrade especially when to deal with big data set in the production environment.<br><br>BTW,  distributed object model in JEE, in a lot cases, is abused. The damage caused by the complexity and loss of performant is bigger than the gain of the distributed architecture. Give me an example of a successful distributed JEE solution.</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+DeanBudd" class="author">Dean Budd</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-13 12:20:45+1100</span><div class="comment-content">Just a quick comment.

I would get as far away from the Distributed Object paradigm as possible. We have to take a SERIOUS look at the real world systems out there that work. eBay, Amazon, Facebook and study the way they do things. There is no Oracle in the world of real scalability.</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+DeanBudd" class="author">Dean Budd</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-13 12:30:15+1100</span><div class="comment-content"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656" oid="103428354485877420656" >Kieran Simpson</a></span>  +1 (I can&#39;t +1 your comment using my phone)</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TerrenceMiao" class="author">Terrence Miao</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-13 12:46:47+1100</span><span> - Updated: 2012-03-13 12:50:26+1100</span><div class="comment-content">Good one Deano. You should teach people the reality of ORM. <br><br>I had an interview with one of my previous employers the other day. I told two people on the panel that you should be very careful about if you use Hibernate as one-size-for-all ORM solution for large data set due to coming up performance issue hit in later stage. <br><br>They asked how to tune for a better performance. I said, partition database, using memory cache (db in memory) improve db I/O throughout, replacing Hibernate with JDBC.<br><br>Furthermore, I hated they asked my opinion about pair programming in their third question. As I said always having another pair of eyes on the codes (codes review) is also very beneficial and effective.<br><br>Not very happy with my &quot;honest&quot; replies, the interview was finished in just 20 minutes.</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+DeanBudd" class="author">Dean Budd</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-13 14:08:53+1100</span><div class="comment-content"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872" oid="112201754385215382872" >Terrence Miao</a></span>  That is probably a good indicator that you shouldn&#39;t work there ;)</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/104947156656943348622" class="author">James Gemmell</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-14 09:46:02+1100</span><div class="comment-content">Buggy software aside, I like the concept of being able to use Coherence as a distributed, shared 2nd level cache for JPA. Using JPA as a backing store for Coherence sounds useful too. Plugging in Coherence to solve a scalabiity problem baked into the design sounds like the war has been lost already and no technology is going to provide the magic bullet. (Woohoo, metaphor soup.)<br><br>There&#39;s a an obvious difference between states and events. How important is it that the events change the state in realtime? In entity-speak this implies finding the current state, updating it then writing it back while taking care to prevent concurrent updates. This will <b>always</b> be slower than a simply persisting events which can be processed more optimally offline or out-of-band, allowing you to smooth out spikes in traffic.<br><br>Talking of  traffic, a certain road tolling solution with which we are intimately familiar had the state-update design baked into the use cases leaving them with bugger all room to move when the inevitable scalability, concurrency and platform bugs surfaced. All of this to satisfy the rather questionable business requirement of &quot;10 mins from roadside to account.&quot;</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TerrenceMiao" class="author">Terrence Miao</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-14 10:16:57+1100</span><div class="comment-content"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/104947156656943348622" oid="104947156656943348622" >James Gemmell</a></span> In the previous project, Coherence is used to load &quot;NEW&quot; state messages, then update messages state to &quot;DISPATCHED&quot;, &quot;PROCESSING&quot;, &quot;PROCESSED&quot;, &quot;FAILED&quot;... depends on the message processing status. Coherence is required to keep re-indexing state column when state change happened at specified interval. At the same time, it needs to write back messages to database if &quot;PROCESSED&quot; or &quot;FAILED&quot;, load &quot;NEW&quot; messages from db and re-index again. <br><br>Coherence is used a generic database, and a lot read / write access between memory and hard disk. When switch on the production, with 50 millions messages in backend db, you can imagine what performance like.</div></div><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656" class="author">Kieran Simpson</a><span class="time"> - 2012-03-14 10:43:05+1100</span><div class="comment-content"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/104947156656943348622" oid="104947156656943348622" >James Gemmell</a></span> Of course the PHP guys have been doing this for years with Memcached.
