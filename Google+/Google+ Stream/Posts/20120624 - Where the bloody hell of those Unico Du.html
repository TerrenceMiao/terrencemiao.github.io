Remember I bumped into him in Silicon Beach Melbourne, a start-ups meetup in November last year, where Rod was looking for Venture Capital investment, and I was looking for free beer ...<br><br>Rod told me in that meeting he maybe back into the job market because he needs more money injection to keep his project moving forward. Quite understandable how big the challenge it is to start something from scratch, doing all the funding, project planning, developing, marketing by yourself. It&#39;s just huge.<br><br>• Thursday&#39;s heavy moring rain caused more problem than I expected. <br><br>First, I woke up later till 8 o&#39;clock. Second, when I tried to drove the nearest train station, I found that road was fully packed from the train station 3.5km away to the door of my home. I had to drive to the opposite direction, 10km further down to a Zone 2 train station. Luckily got on the trains half an hour later. I was off the train and change to City Loop in Northern Melbourne because need valid my Zone 1 Metcard. So in the first time I jumped off the train in Parliament station. <br><br>While I waiting for train stop and door open, rolling my eyes in disbelief that I saw my old boss Neil (Ambegoda) was  in the same carriage, only one meter away. He was off Parliament station too.<br><br>Neil told me he is currently working as a contractor for a State department. I just realised he is sitting in the next builing of my workplace. We had been neighbours for a few months now. <br><br>&quot;Great neighbourhood are people don&#39;t talk to each other.&quot; But I will be nasty this time and I&#39;m going to catch up with Neil for a lunch. Yes, I&#39;m going to talk to him, a lot :-)<br><br>• Friday this week is an unproductive day have to spent most of day to prepare the showcase in the afternoon. Tired of the whole week, finally I dragged my body out of office at 5 o&#39;clock.<br><br>Just I turned me out of the building on the turning door, rolling my eyes in disbelief again, I saw Rosalie (Weerasinghe) Duval, our Test Manager in TransUrban project, turned her into the building on the same turning door. It seemed that we have been in the same company, in the same building for a few months, but don&#39;t know each other hides so closely ...<br><br>Well, this is a week hardly to forget. Is it time to think of the past, pick up your shovel, and dig up old colleagues? :-P<br><br>Cheerio.</div></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: <a href="https://plus.google.com/circles/112201754385215382872-4230bd3f8f1a3374">Unico swamp</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872">Terrence Miao</a></div><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+CasperCasper">Casper Casper</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/113772070338256541416">Bryan Murphy</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656">Kieran Simpson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104947156656943348622">James Gemmell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DeanBudd">Dean Budd</a></div></div></body></html>
