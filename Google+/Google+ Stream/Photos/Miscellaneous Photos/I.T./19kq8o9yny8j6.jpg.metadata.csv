Of course - to adopt agile methodologies ...; For some technologies that come to mind: deny it is dead and push it from behind believing it can only get better and that the smell will go away.; Just because consultants and book peddlers do their best to ruin it, doesn&#39;t mean agile should die. Non-tech people still need educating in the basic tenants of agile :)<br />; Agreed <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/118327838139592050858"" oid=""118327838139592050858"">Casper Casper</a></span>, vendors and bad consultancies have ruined what Agile is about (just like they ruined what could have been a revolution with SOA).  However, I&#39;m leaning towards agreeing with Pragmatic Dave that we should kill off Agile and birth Agility because it&#39;s harder to abuse, Agility is about what you are/do not what product you use, or process you follow.  As <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/117411118917273581736"" oid=""117411118917273581736"">Dean Budd</a></span> hammered at me once &quot;Are you quickly able to meet the business need with quality outcomes?&quot;  But vendors can&#39;t <del>lock stupid people into ridiculous contracts</del> make a profit on a simple statement like that ;); This cartoon has always been funny... even 25 years later.; <b>Agile is a culture, not a set of practices.</b> Alan Kay said that <b>programming today has become a pop culture.</b><br /><br />Another reference that Agile has already being corrupted - <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-corruption-of-agile/240166698"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-corruption-of-agile/240166698</a><br /><br />Big five <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/108100508440823014305"" oid=""108100508440823014305"">Oleg Kiorsak</a></span> ; I use the lower case agile to describe this.<br />Capitalised Agile is the bad one ;); What, like &quot;The manifesto which must not be named&quot;?

Whereas the word agile is a general concept that can be applied to writing software.; Dead horse theory and Agile<br /><br />Ways to remediate failed  projects (aka dead horses):<br /><br />. Buy a stronger whip.<br />. Change riders.<br />. Say things like, “This is the way we have always ridden this horse.”<br />. Appoint a committee to study the horse.<br />. Arrange to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.<br />. Increase the standards to ride dead horses.<br />. Appoint a tiger team to revive the dead horse.<br />. Create training to increase riding ability.<br />. Compare the state of dead horses in today’s environment.<br />. Change the requirements declaring that “This horse is not dead.”<br />. Hire contractors to ride the dead horse.<br />. Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.<br />. Declare that “No horse is too dead to beat.”<br />. Provide additional funding to increase the horse’s performance.<br />. Do a Cost Analysis study to see if contractors can ride it cheaper.<br />. Purchase a product to make dead horses run faster.<br />. Declare the horse is “better, faster and cheaper” dead.<br />. Form a quality circle to find uses for dead horses.<br />. Revisit the performance requirements for horses.<br />. Say this horse was procured with cost as an independent variable.<br />. Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.<br />. Outsource the dead horse to a low-cost country.<br />. <b>Try switching to Agile ….</b><br />. <b>When that doesn’t work, Try switching to Lean</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://agilemindstorm.com/2011/06/20/dead-horse-and-agile/"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://agilemindstorm.com/2011/06/20/dead-horse-and-agile/</a><br />﻿","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
