"The Wealth Stakes.png","Australia once again has the wealthiest households in the world, with strong house prices and powerful superannuation returns putting us back on top for the first time since 2013.

According to a new Credit Suisse global survey, Australia tops a median household wealth table ahead of 211 countries including money magnet Switzerland and traditional rivals the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the countries of Scandinavia.

The composition of household wealth in Australia is heavily skewed towards non-financial assets, which averaged $US304,500 and form 60 per cent of gross household assets.

With most of their money tied up in the value of homes, which they can’t tap for spending, or their superannuation, which they can’t access until they are at retirement age, many Australians may not feel as wealthy as the report suggests.

There are 1.3 million US dollar millionaires now in Australia and the group will number 1.8 million in five years time - up 41 per cent - according to the report.","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Txco5OhEJu0/W8smTXwnVzI/AAAAAAAAY7c/_ySeQVJD4VEkOp5FhSOhCW0XHyZ4XB5FACLABGAYYCw/s0-d/The%2BWealth%2BStakes.png","","0","Oct 20, 2018, 12:57:48 PM UTC","Feb 5, 2019, 8:52:06 PM UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0"
