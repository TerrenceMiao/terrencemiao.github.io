And is it near the end of life of Struts?</b><br><br>During last few days I bumped from gardening hobby into JSF (JavaServer Faces), actually it&#39;s JSF 2. Attracting to my attention is not because of JSF is Oracle backed, propagandaed and carpet bombed, but also because JSF becomes everyone&#39;s darling, again!<br><br>Remember I had a discussion with people&#39;s favourite Italian boy Dino Baetano about JSF, while we concluded that poor performance in the early implementation of JSF (JSF 1) kill a lot enthusiastic Java developers. This is almost announce a death penalty to JSF. Time fly till I come across this article wrote in 2005 on based on JSF 1, giving architectural overview of JSF, overturn the &quot;bias and discrimination&quot; I had to JSF before. Interesting enough, there is comparison of MVC 2 architecture, represented by Struts vs. event driven, component development, represented by JSF. <br><br>Richard Hightower, author of this article, claims against <b>Struts is that it can feel more procedural than object-oriented,</b> and doesn&#39;t offer a component model from the core package. <b>Struts makes the mistake of separating behaviour and state, which leaves many Java developers feeling like they&#39;re programming COBOL!</b><br><br>This is a serious allegation.<br><br>MVC 1 architecture was a small revolution in OO world when it came out of the corner. But it never helps reducing the tedious work for developers. Not ever getting better, MVC 2 model is still a heavy approach. So it&#39;s not strange that Ruby on Rails and Google Web Toolkit (GWT) come out as alternative solutions for web applications.<br><br>Back to JSF 2, which has harvested all the evolutionary fruits from JEE 6, Spring, Ruby, is getting up to another level. For example:<br><br>• Fine-grained event driven development and events are easily tied to server-side code<br>• Component based development. Reusable components enforce Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle<br>• Annotation and IoC support simplifies codes and makes them less <br>• Enforces Convention over Configuration (CoC) principle<br>• Controller classes aren&#39;t tied to JSF at all, making them easier to test<br>• The statefulness of the components is provided through the JSF framework. On the contrary, maybe it&#39;s backdrop for poor response from application.<br><br>Oh man, is it time we shall give another look of JSF?</div><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jsf1/index.html" target="_blank" class="link-embed"><h3>JSF for nonbelievers: Clearing the FUD about JSF</h3><img src="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jsf1/figure1.gif" alt=""></a></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112307710908425288030">Martin Paulo</a></div><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+pandiarajanrajinbam">Pandiarajan Inbam</a></div></div><div class="comments"><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+DeanBudd" class="author">Dean Budd</a><span class="time"> - 2012-04-16 11:16:50+1000</span><span> - Updated: 2012-04-16 11:17:36+1000</span><div class="comment-content">Forget server-side generated dynamic content.

Very creative and deep thinking!<br><br><i>In 2012, the &quot;dumb terminal&quot; style of application is long gone, and instead we have a sea of smart clients: the JavaScript applications that run in our web browsers, and the native applications that run on our phones or tablets. They talk to an ever-growing array of scalable, distributed cloud services, such as Facebook Connect (authentication), Google Maps (location awareness), Amazon S3 (storage), and whatever custom services a particular app may need to run in the cloud due to security or persistence considerations.</i><br><br><i>Meteor is a new application platform for this new era. It is built around Smart Packages: little bundles of code that can run on a client, inside a cloud service, or both, and that can manage their lifetime inside the modern distributed environment.</i><br><br><b>Wow!</b></div></div></div></body></html>
