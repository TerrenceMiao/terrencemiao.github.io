"2012-07-15 13.33.54.jpg","Ripped off Aussies

Becoming an Apple guy is a tough life decision, like you want to marry someone you are not sure whether you should fully commit. Buying a MacBook Pro doesn't mean always a happy ending, like you have finally married someone then find  out there are something you really don't know about her.

This happened to me when I try to squeeze a little more juicy out from an Apple.

13"" screen size is good enough for web browsing but not good enough if you try to see 10 apps window opened at the same time while coding. In addition, you don't want to program later and play some music to relax then find out it's already 2am, your dog even your noisy pain-in-the-backend neighbours have got into sleep.

I went to Apple Online shop and had a look.

A mini Display Port to VGA Adapter for Apple Macbook Pro costs 30 bucks. An Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic $35.

Oh dear ...

Oh shit ...

Immediately I felt I had been trapped into a booby trap wishfully set up by Apple for the dumb silly people. I had to admire Apple's sale skill luring unsophisticated consumers with their cheap or free lollies. But $65 for such simple accessories for a pocket shallow person is like legally rob a man in daylight and in public.

Also I went to the local JB-HiFi, Dick Smith and Good Guys for bargains. Unfortunately, same accessories cost the same price as Apple Online shop. This is maybe why Steve Jobs wages ""thermonuclear war"" in the patent fight. Great monopoly!

But enough is enough. $65 is not too big but still better put into Australian Government bond which return 10% per annual currently than buying something then worthy nothing one year later.

Finally I was back on eBay, a company which has the lousy reputation for fraudulent and trickery business practice, which I had distanced for more than five years. Quickly I find out Apple's accessories duplicators I wanted to ...

A mini Display Port to VGA Adapter for Apple Macbook Pro for $7.79. An Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic $3.50. Made in China, shipped from Hong Kong with free international shipment.

20 days later, Both of my order arrived. Plugged them into MBP, everything worked fine. They are maybe not as shiny as the ""genuine"" ones, but they carry on their work and do very well.
