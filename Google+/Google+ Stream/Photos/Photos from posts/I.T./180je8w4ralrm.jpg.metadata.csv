Now, thanks to the Internet, we know this is not true.”<br />― Robert Wilensky; The vision of BPEL !; Comon now, BPEL isn&#39;t that bad. Check out another Oracle Policy Automation product (an Aus company bought out by the big red). Supposedly you can just copy and paste a word document and render those into policies/rules. Pretty nifty, even a BA can do it!; Might be usable in a few years once Oracle&#39;s customers (aka beta testers) have shaken the bugs out of it.  And yes BPEL is that bad (please don&#39;t get me started - I have been doing very well to forget how bad it is); I still happen to think that BPEL is best used for the job for which it was intended - service composition and orchestration. Abusing BPEL outside this paradigm for building systems better suited to complex event processing and ESBs can only be a long and painful journey. <i>When all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail</i> - but it doesn&#39;t mean that the hammer is useless to start with.","; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
