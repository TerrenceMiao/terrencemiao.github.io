Theres a small chance I may be visiting the states soon, so I might even get the chance to pick one up myself :)<br /><br />Not sure I believe the CMDA/LTE/HSPA line... It would be nice though!; Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and Google Nexus smartphone announcement can be watched live-streamed on Android&#39;s YouTube channel - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/android"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://www.youtube.com/android</a> on Oct 19th, 1pm Melbourne time.<br /><br />Can&#39;t wait more ...; I&#39;d like to see a comparison with the HTC Sensation.; Watching the launch now, very impressive!; High Definition Super AMOLED!; Hahahah face unlock worked about as well as I expected :); lol!; I&#39;m waiting to watch the preso off YouTube (I missed the start).; They&#39;ve been fishing for applause and wooo!s for the entire presentation.  Took em 45 minutes to get one.  I think its because the presentation isn&#39;t happening in the US.; I don&#39;t see any SDK download on the developer site :(  booo!; Ooooh, actually at the moment I see melted server :p; Its up now :); Buy buy buy! Sell your children and buy this phone :-D<br /><br />Ice Cream Sandwich is the soul of this platform. I can feel the similarities of Google Plus and Honeycomb inside it. Also I try to imagine how Ice Cream Sandwich looks like when it is powered on a tablet. Appreciate Google engineers deliver Android 4.0 that unifies tablet and smartphone software, and the first time you could put the fragmental apps under the same hood.; <a href=""http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-4.0.html"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-4.0.html</a><br /><br />Download SDK and have a first taste mouth watering Ice Cream Sandwich in emulator.; This will probably be my next phone. Hopefully Telstra will be selling it soon, as I&#39;m looking to change carriers.; This is possibly my first ever smart phone! I&#39;m current have a Nokia 5880. It has a colour screen. Not bad!; The Nokia N900 was my first smart phone.  Although not so smart without a data plan, so I don&#39;t use it to its full ability.  I love having a qwerty keyboard, and I&#39;m sure to miss this with my next phone.  I need to try without a qwerty keyboard to see if it works for me or not.<br /><br />The N900 has been a good phone, but I only ever bought it thinking it would last me a year or so until some good Androids come out.  Alas the Maemo OS was dead when the N900 came on to the market. Nokia really screwed that up - they went to market with their Linux OS on the &quot;mobile&quot; years ago, but with WiFi only (no GSM, etc).  It&#39;s a rock-solid OS and I&#39;ve found few things to fault it.  But as I said, it&#39;s a dead platform ...<br /><br />After spending some time on research yesterday, it&#39;s probably more likely that I&#39;ll buy the phone outright through an online retailer rather than through a Telco like Telstra.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/100262877374602766225"" oid=""100262877374602766225"">Michael Poloni</a></span> Well mate, you have to forget QWERTY keyboard and learn how to use touch screen. The world is changing. Of course, voice input is becoming popular.<br /><br />Better with Telstra I recommend. Their service is bad, but infrastructure is good, plus 4G network. Trust me, I don&#39;t own Telstra shares :-)","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
