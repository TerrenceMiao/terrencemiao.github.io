The Gaussian integral, also known as the Euler–Poisson integral, is the integral of the Gaussian function
$f(x)=e^{-x^2}$ over the entire real line. Named after the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, the integral is

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d x=\sqrt{\pi}

Solve this expression:

### Solution

$$
81^{\sin^2 x} + 81^{\cos^2 x} = 30
$$

We know that $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$. Using this identity, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
81^{\sin^2 x} + 81^{1 - \sin^2 x} = 30
$$

Now, let's make a substitution to simplify the equation further. Let $y = \sin^2 x$. Then, the equation becomes:

$$
81^y + 81^{1 - y} = 30
$$

Since $81 = 3^4$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
(3^4)^y + (3^4)^{1 - y} = 30
$$

Now, apply the exponent rule: $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$

$$
3^{4y} + 3^{4(1 - y)} = 30
$$

At this point, it's challenging to solve the equation analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the approximate value of $y$ and, subsequently, the value of $x$. Keep in mind that there might be multiple solutions for $x$ within the range of $[0, 2\pi]$ or even beyond, depending on the context of the problem.

Let $z = (3^4)^y$, then:

$$
z^2 - 30z + 81 = 0
$$

the solutions are $z = 3$ and $z = 27$:

$$
(3^4)^y = 3
$$

$$
(3^4)^y = 27
$$

then $y = \frac{1}{4}$ and $y = \frac{3}{4}$, and:

$$
\sin^2 x = \frac{1}{4}
$$

$$
\sin^2 x = \frac{3}{4}
$$

then:

$$
x \in \left\{ \frac{\pi}{6} + 2\pi n, \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi n, \frac{7\pi}{6} + 2\pi n, \frac{11\pi}{6} + 2\pi n \right\}
$$

and:

$$
x \in \left\{ \frac{\pi}{3}+2\pi n, \frac{2\pi}{3}+2\pi n, \frac{4\pi}{3}+2\pi n, \frac{5\pi}{3}+2\pi n \right\}
$$

where n is an integer.
