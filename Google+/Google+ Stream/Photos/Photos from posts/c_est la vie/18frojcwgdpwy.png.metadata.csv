"Live Traffic Report Melbourne.png","Getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning wouldn't be called lazy.

After a hot-water shower and long time missing full size breakfast, checking world stock markets which is another disaster day in Wall Street after Italy election result sending earthquake around the world, I'm ready to go to work before 7am.

But it's too later ...

Looking outside of my place, I'm shocked that cars already have been packed up from train station 5 km away up to my doorbell. Good weather condition, rain pouring down which is very good for thirsty garden and run-out-at-bottom water tank, but it's bad for traffic making even worse that everyone wants to rush to the main road in a comfy car.

So have to trapped myself at home waiting for traffic a bit easier. Searching for live traffic report and find out that Google Maps already offers this service.

Question raised how the hell Google could manage to do this?

Anything that eases (by using Google Traffic you&#39;re able to dodge hot-spots) traffic congestion gets my vote (and location data)<br /><br />=D; With a tap of a button you can choose a less busy route. Love Google Traffic on the Android! <a href=""http://goo.gl/LjucI"" class=""ot-anchor"">goo.gl/LjucI</a>; There&#39;s rumour that PTV will be releasing data that other providers can use later this year.  I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;ll be real-time data, but at least there will be timetable data.  This will enable Google and other providers to tap into this information.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/100262877374602766225"" oid=""100262877374602766225"">Michael Poloni</a></span> any reference for this PTV data? How does it work?; Sorry, I read it somewhere in the rail thread on Whirlpool.  Far too many posts to go back and search through.  Somebody had contacted PTV about it and the response back was later this year.; I think the PTV data will allow Google Maps to give directions via public transport in addition to walking and driving like it currently does.  This already works in some cities (Sydney apparently) and whilst the Metro journey planner is OK, it doesn&#39;t super impose the journey on a map so hopefully the PTV is made available sooner rather than later.; A proper map would be very welcome for the journey planner!  If PTV can release the data/API publicly then it should prove to be less work + cost for them - provide access and allow other businesses to innovate with it.; That&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/100262877374602766225"" oid=""100262877374602766225"">Michael Poloni</a></span>, why the government bodies wont just release the data.  The bloke who did a great app for buses in Sydney was shut down pretty quickly.  Yet he offered a service to the community (free app) that did something that nothing else did; namely report the position of buses on Google Maps so you had a fair idea of how late it was running.<br /><br />The free train and tram apps for Melbourne are updated faster with better UIs and less bugs than the official apps.  Save my tax dollars and let the free market work.  There&#39;s a reason that the third party apps are used by so many people.; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/103428354485877420656"" oid=""103428354485877420656"">Kieran Simpson</a></span> seems to be political nonesense and fear by managers to &#39;protect their arse&#39; lest information be public!  Perhaps there&#39;s simply too many luddites in the public service who don&#39;t understand social media and seem oblivious to advances in technology.; Ah, found it.  It was actually on @bowen&#39;s twitter feed and I even RT&#39;d it at the time!<br /><br /><a href=""http://imgur.com/HXr1CQd"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://imgur.com/HXr1CQd</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/18xv1b/google_transit_coming_to_melbourne_mid_2013/"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/18xv1b/google_transit_coming_to_melbourne_mid_2013/</a><br /><br />(courtesy <a href=""https://twitter.com/danielbowen/status/304761242269138944"" class=""ot-anchor"">https://twitter.com/danielbowen/status/304761242269138944</a> )","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
