Photographer Kris Dutson has turned Britains notoriously inclement weather into a series of stunning pictures. When most people stay indoors weather nut Kris spends hours out and about waiting for the rain to clear or a break in the clouds to get the perfect shot. His pictures are not accidents  - he studies meteological charts and even carries a sun compass to plan his photographs.
