We need some bullet control. Men, we need to control the bullets, that’s right. I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars… five thousand dollars per bullet… You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders.</i><br /><br /><i>Yeah! Every time somebody get shot we’d say, ‘Damn, he must have done something ... Shit, he’s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his ass.’</i><br /><br /><i>And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. ‘Man I would blow your fucking head off…if I could afford it.’ ‘I’m gonna get me another job, I’m going to start saving some money, and you’re a dead man. You’d better hope I can’t get no bullets on layaway.’</i><br /><br /><i>So even if you get shot by a stray bullet, you wouldn&#39;t have to go to no doctor to get it taken out. Whoever shot you would take their bullet back, like &quot;I believe you got my property.”</i><br /><br />― Chris Rock; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/117411118917273581736"" oid=""117411118917273581736"">Dean Budd</a></span> but that then creates in-equality... based on &#39;income&#39;... as for some people tens and even hundreds of thousands is no big deal...","; ; ; ","; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
