"Spotify_criticism_low_payments_to_musicians.jpeg","Living a life in the cloud

I logon Facebook during last week more time than I visited it in last six months. This is not because I spot on some security holes let me find out Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in their undies or intimate video tape. One of my former colleagues who is an active Facebook hangouter, starts sharing his favourite classical music via Spotify on Facebook.

Quite admire his personal interest and taste, I follow up since then everyday. I download Spotify client, play his choice of classical tune at background in the house. And I quite like it.

Now there is a small problem. After six months absolutely free music, especially after you become addictive junkie, which is a very good sale practice, you'd either pay a loyalty to Spotify or be kicked out, no question asked.

This let me ponder whether just like electricity, water, gas and internet are the irresistible part in our daily life, we should also subscribe online newspaper for information, streaming TV program for satisfaction that there more silly people than you and me in this world, and unlimited music in the cloud which let us find the peace inside our hearts?

Imagine a simple life in the cloud, without possessions and borders ...","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-G_6iwVlz6vs/T8Axd0wTKKI/AAAAAAAAKww/skjGlaJ69HU8eVxu4NcgiQz7rS5JsbsogCLABGAYYCw/s0-d/Spotify_criticism_low_payments_to_musicians.jpeg","","1471","May 26, 2012, 1:27:19 AM UTC","Feb 5, 2019, 8:51:47 PM UTC","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","","<span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872"" oid=""112201754385215382872"">Terrence Miao</a></span> I have&#39;t looked into the cloud music properly yet (youtube surely doesn&#39;t count) - which one can you recommend - &#39;spotify&#39; or &#39;<a href=""http://last.fm"" class=""ot-anchor"">last.fm</a>&#39; or whatelse is there?; <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/108100508440823014305"" oid=""108100508440823014305"">Oleg Kiorsak</a></span> Played <a href=""http://last.fm"" class=""ot-anchor"">last.fm</a> on Android tablet and Spotify on Mac. I reckon they have the same business model, free tasting at first then pay the subscription later, the most important, you can join the group of people who have the similar interest and sanguinary via social media, in my case, the Facebook. <br /><br />Both <a href=""http://last.fm"" class=""ot-anchor"">last.fm</a> and Spotify host all the music and songs somewhere in the cloud, the intellectual right is belong to artists, audience (you) can&#39;t upload your own copy of an artist music work to cloud, not like chaotic Youtube. The success and mess created by Youtube I reckon is it walks on the brink of law and underworld. <br /><br />Anyway, Spotify and <a href=""http://last.fm"" class=""ot-anchor"">last.fm</a> seem have a sustainable path to success. Give a play Spotify on Mac or iPad. I quite like this UI design and UX, better than iTunes I reckon.; thanks, <span class=""proflinkWrapper""><span class=""proflinkPrefix"">+</span><a class=""proflink"" href=""https://plus.google.com/112201754385215382872"" oid=""112201754385215382872"">Terrence Miao</a></span> <br />(I tried <a href=""http://fast.fm"" class=""ot-anchor"">fast.fm</a> but was getting a bit confused how stuff is organized... seems like you have adopt some arbitrary &quot;playlists&quot; of some others subjective choice)...<br />I will try spotify next...","; ; ","; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
