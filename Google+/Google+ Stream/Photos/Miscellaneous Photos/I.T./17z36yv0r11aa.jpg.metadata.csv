"Console 2.jpg","Looking for multiple tabs solution for Cygwin terminal for a long time.

I used to use mrxvt which built from source codes to run on Windows 7, but crashed on Windows XP. Then tried WinTabber, a nice tool can integrate a few native Windows applications into tabs window but keeps crashing after a certain time.

At last, I give Console 2 a try. Very stable with the basic tab feature I want.

It&#39;s quite good and powerful tool, working with Cygwin mintty; select, highlight, copy, middle button paste between different terminals all work well. The only issue is it&#39;s too powerful, it can do many things. My requirement is multiple tabs feature in Cygwin mintty. So the smaller tool, simple add-on is better.<br /><br />But thanks for ConEmu tip! ; Wow, &quot;too powerful&quot; ;) But, I&#39;m pleased that tests passed in your env.","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","","","","","","","","","0","0"
